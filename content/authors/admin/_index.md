I am a Computer Science Masters student at Columbia University. My specialization is Computer Science and Robotics. I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in 2017 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. In the summer of 2019, I was research intern at Robotics Embedded Research Laboratory, University of Southern California. I worked full-time as a C++ and JavaScript software developer at Adobe Inc. at Acrobat team. In the summer of 2016, I was a machine learning research intern at Big Data Experience Lab, Adobe.
