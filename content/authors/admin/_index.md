I am a Computer Science Master student at Columbia University. I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in 2017 with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. In the summer of 2019, I was research intern at [Robotics Embedded Research Laboratory](https://robotics.usc.edu/resl/), University of Southern California. I worked full-time as a C++ and JavaScript software developer at Adobe Inc. at Acrobat team. In the summer of 2016, I was a machine learning research intern at Big Data Experience Lab, Adobe.

Since 2019, I am working with [Prof. Shuran Song](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~shurans) and contributing to robotics research.
